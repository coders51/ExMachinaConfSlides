# ExMachinaConfSlides

Ex Machina is a one-day event for Machine Learning practitioners. We’re going to shed the hype and focus on the pragmatic stuff: how Machine Learning works in practice, how companies are using it, and how you can apply it today. We’ll have a few talks, and plenty of time for an open space discussion.

We'll start at 9:30 and finish at 18:00. We'll have talks in the morning, and plenty of time for an Open Space in the afternoon. We also have social events on the night before, if you're already in Bologna.

From deep learning to chatbots, Machine Learning is changing the world. Be a part of that change.

We had our first conference on 25 January 2019. In this repository you can find all the slides from the event!
